As the project progressed and received several design awards, 
new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design. 
The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us 
to do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. 
It was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat 
and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders 
and focus on the main goals of the project: 
that is, to uncover the river, treat its water, and provide public spaces for all. 
We were actually very lucky, and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening. 
Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. 
This is how it looked like about six years ago. 
This is how it looks like today. 
It's still under construction, but actually it is heavily used by the local population. 
And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed. 
This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard. 
Then after many years of work, the river with clean water, uncovered. 
And finally, you can see here the river when the project will be completed.
So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation will keep on changing 
and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city, 
but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect, 
we have set up the core idea of the project into motion;
that is, to transform the river from sewage to public space for all, 
thereby making sure that the city of Fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants 
rather than a mummified heritage.
Thank you very much.
